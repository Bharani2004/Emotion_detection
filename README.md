Biometric emotion detection uses physiological and behavioural data—such as facial expressions, voice tone, heart rate, and eye movement—to analyse emotional states in real time. 
This emerging technology has opened new opportunities across multiple fields, offering a deeper understanding of human emotions and behaviour. 
From healthcare and marketing to security and education, the integration of biometric emotion analysis is transforming how humans interact with machines and how organizations understand their users. 
The emotion-based music playback feature, implemented using Pygame, added an interactive dimension by mapping detected emotions to corresponding audio tracks, achieving seamless transitions when emotions changed. 
This introduction explores the growing field of emotion detection and highlights its significance in shaping future innovations.
